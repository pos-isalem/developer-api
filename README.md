# developer-api


## Runing Project

Run `npm install` in order to install all the packages locally.

Run `node run build` to get new build. 


In case you want to modify the code and still get new builds automatically, open the vcode dialog (command + shift + p), and choose Run Task, then Choose `npm watch` and finally  choose continue without...etc, then a new terminal will popup, this will get a new build everytime you save a file in the project.   




## Code scaffolding
 `scaffolding is cool word hhhh`
